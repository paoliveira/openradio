### What is this ? ###

* **Open Radio** is the project which is use [Android Auto SDK](http://developer.android.com/auto/index.html), innovative tool to bring Android Apps into vehicle's **Human Machine Interface (HMI)**, to provide live streaming of the world wide Radio Stations into the vehicle over Android mobile.
* **Dirble service is dead** ~~This project is use the [Dirble's API](https://dirble.com/developer/api) - a service that provides a list of radio stations broadcasting their live stream on the Internet.~~

* Android requirements : Android 4.0 (API level 14) (new APIs for implementing audio playback that is compatible with Auto) or newer.

### Delivery files ###

* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yuriy.openradio) - this application is  suitable now for the Android Media Browser simulator as well as for the Android Auto.

### How to install and run ###
* There is a possibility to run application as general Android one, just to be sure that everything working as expected.
* **But the main feature is that application is fully compatible with vehicle's system.**

In order to run application just like it does on vehicle it is necessary to install [Android Auto for Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.projection.gearhead&hl=en). Once it is done - swipe from the left side and select **Open Radio** application from the list. 
**Enjoy!**
